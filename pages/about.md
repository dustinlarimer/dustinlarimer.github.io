# About

Hello, my name is Dustin Larimer. I’m a Designer, inventor and creative facilitator based in San Antonio, Texas.  I have an unhealthy affection for whiteboards, technology, social complexity, economics, organizational anthropology and life systems.  I practice Design as a means of igniting and accelerating the change I want to see in the world. In the spring of 2011 I became the first MFA graduate of [Design Management at SCAD](http://www.scad.edu/design-management/), and dove head first into the startup renaissance that was just beginning to simmer.  Over the past two years I've had the wonderful privilege of working with world-class programs like [TechStars](http://www.techstars.com/cloud/), [Geekdom](http://geekdom.com/) and [SURGE Accelerator](http://surgeaccelerator.com), along with hundreds of brilliant, inspiring founders and high-tech creatives. What I've learned in that time is that while society puts a premium on the innately creative, talented individual, the qualities we should really be building toward are adaptive learning and creative_ courage _within the many communities we each inhabit.  Innovation is a process that can be mastered and repeated, but it's messy as hell and delivers far fewer hits than misses.  Having the courage to try and fail many times over in front of your most respected peers takes something special, and I believe it's as much about community support as it is individual determination. In the winter of 2013, I began developing [a team training program](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/workshops/) that is purposefully engineered to build the competencies required for generating on-demand creativity and sparks of insight that drive disruptive innovation.  Anyone can enroll in the program, and I'll gladly travel anywhere on Earth to share what I've learned.
