Across nearly every industry, disruptive innovators are displacing their predecessors, winning both customers and talent with unnerving precision. Breakthrough innovation is now the norm, and staying competitive means finding the creative courage to continuously and aggressively challenge the status quo – both inside and outside of your organization. The best companies in the world know this, and are investing heavily in their number one competitive advantage: the creative capacity of their people. This training program is purposefully engineered to develop the competencies required for generating on-demand creativity and sparks of insight that drive disruptive innovation. By blending design thinking and service design methodologies into a hands-on experience, even the most adamantly "non-creative" team members can be transformed into highly creative contributors.
