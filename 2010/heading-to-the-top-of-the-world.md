# Heading to the Top of the World

I'm losing my mind to a nine hour layover at London Heathrow Airport.  In four hours I board Kingfisher Airlines flight 2, bound for New Delhi, to begin a 24-day trek into the Himalayas of northern India.  I will be joining the Himalayan Health Exchange on a medical anthropology expedition, and will visit the cities of Leh, in Ladakh, and Dharamsala, in Himachal.  The fact that I am the lone designer on this trip has already raised a few eyebrows, but all the better – just an opportunity to strike up good conversation!  This expedition will surely offer the experience of a lifetime... total immersion in the social, religious, economic and environmental context of a remote culture at the top of the world. Equally intriguing is the chance to observe the creative dynamics of a team of Western students and faculty who have gone to great expense to participate.  At a time when so many designers are chomping at the bit to apply their expertise in the humanitarian and social development sectors, a grad-level design field school program could be an exciting way to develop the real-world experience necessary to jump-start just such a practice.  I look forward to learning more about both the operation and the team, as well as understanding how to best manage the dynamics between participants.  I want to know what factors lead to favorable outcomes, what motivates the most creative participants in a foreign context, and - most importantly - I want to know how creative exchanges could be best facilitated so as to avoid disrupting or damaging the sociocultural systems of our hosts. I have some cool data-collecton and analysis methods planned, so keep an eye out for the follow-up when I return!
