# Couchsurfing in Bochum

After we had enough of Nice we caught a second night train through Paris and on toward Cologne, where we hopped a regional to Bochum.  It was quite a trek just for a party, but, then again, it was quite a party.  The best part of [Couchsurfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org/) – and, you could argue, the real reason anyone bothers – is the people you'll meet along the way.  The party we traveled so far to attend was a backpacker barbecue.  About 30 world travelers made it to the party, which incidentally became such a good time that the Polizei made an appearance as well.  The good time migrated, unfazed, to a pub exactly .5 blocks away and continued into the wee hours of the morning.
