# JCB North American Go-To-Market Strategy

![](/assets_c/2010/04/09-IDEI-b-cropped-proto-custom_3.jpg)JCB is the third largest manufacturer of heavy construction machinery in the world, but I'm guessing you've never heard of them... unless you live near their North American headquarters in Savannah, Georgia, of course, or a series of markets throughout New England, the Chicago-Milwaukee area, or the Gulf Coast. JCB's North American factory specializes in backhoes, military-grade earth movers, and skid-steer loaders, or SSLs. JCB have masterfully engineered their machines to be the safest in the world. They have an incredible global presence, and supply our troops with workhorse equipment. How, then, with such an impressive track record, do they only have a 1.5% share of the domestic SSL market?  This project was designed as an interdisciplinary collaboration between the [School of Communication Arts](http://www.scad.edu/programs/communication-arts) (Graphic Design, Advertising Design) and the [School of Design](http://www.scad.edu/programs/design) (Design Management, Industrial Design). Prior to this project, we haven't had many opportunities to work directly with our CommArts contemporaries, so this mashup yielded a lot of unique insights and concept creation, and even a few methodological crises - a real nice time! :) Our mission was to develop a go-to-market strategy for the release of a new product in the north american marketplace. The stated objectives of the project were to 

  1. Clearly understand JCB's product and sales features,
  2. Determine the customer perceived value of sales features on JCB and competitive skid steer loaders, and
  3. Develop the best way to communicate the benefits of the JCB skid steer loader to customers (including the promotion of attachments)
Additionally, the desired output was to 
  1. Bring the voice of the customer into JCB, 
  2. Highlight product concerns and new opportunities with existing SSL loaders,
  3. Highlight and validate trends from market data, and
  4. Mock up potential promotional material suggestions of the best medium to communicate the message to customers
The final presentation was delivered to the CEO and several executive staff members of JCB. We approached this challenge first and foremost with an unreal amount of research (given our 10 week timeline). We split into three teams distributed by disciplinary background. Diversity in collaborative endeavors fuels greater problem-finding creativity, and we leveraged this to the fullest. In later ideation phases we regrouped by discipline, as less disciplinary diversity promotes stronger problem-solving creativity. Each of the three teams focused on a different aspect of the business environment: customers (both dealers and consumers), competitors' positioning and strategy, and external market forces. This created the conditions for the teams to work independently while ensuring a reasonable amount of overlap to fill in the gaps. Findings from our first phase were thrown up on the wall, debated and digested. The teams were shuffled once again, and we packed our bags. During phase two, each team was sent to a different corner of the country to meet the soldiers on the front-line of JCB's campaign for market share. We spoke with general managers, sales staff, mechanics, and customers. We brought back transcribed audio and video, photos, and a serious sum of doubts and concerns. As we all returned to Savannah to share our experiences we immediately began to sense a common thread of discord. Each of the dealerships we visited had their own unique needs and goals, concerns and strategies for success. A few dealers shared certain challenges, but had totally different solutions in play. Another key insight was that they were all pursuing different niche markets, opting to leave construction and agriculture to giants John Deere, Caterpillar, and Case/New Holland. It was far more effective for them to focus on maintaining relationships with loyal customers in specialized service operations. Our earlier research included the assembly of a GIS mashup of all SSL sales across the country from the year 2000 to 2009, including industry-type for each sale. We discovered that construction and agriculture accounted for the largest category concentration across most of JCB's strongest markets, but there also existed a long-tail of various specialty businesses, most of which being small family-owned operations. The dealers knew exactly what they were doing... JCB's core attribute is safety, and small-scale private businesses in 2009 had an immediate incentive to hedge against the financial blow an accident or injury would carry. By putting focused collateral that speaks directly to the concerns and challenges of these niche segments in the hands of their dealers, JCB has a terrific opportunity to rewrite "the good" that defines quality in a machine, and establish a guardian-style relationship with an under-served market. Another recommendation stemming from our research was to extend an existing intranet to introduce a channel of communication between dealers, so that insights, advice, strategies and recognition could flow freely throughout the dealer network. We gave JCB a lot of strong insights and recommendations, and I believe the project was a success. We debunked previous assumptions about both the company and the product, and, through extensive research, validated new definitions and perceptions that exist within JCB's market. We discovered who JCB's customers are, what attributes and features really do influence consumer behavior, literally handed JCB a map of where to focus their efforts, and mocked up potential promotional materials to best capture and deliver the message. This project was a great opportunity to apply classroom theory to the real-world business environment.
