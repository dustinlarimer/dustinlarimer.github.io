# Looking back, looking forward

It's been <del>awhile</del> a few thousand miles since my last post.  In June I ditched Georgia for some river exploration in south Texas.  Later that month I went to Switzerland to wrap up a 10-month social network analysis research project aimed at identifying and analyzing student-led innovation in the Swiss public school system.  A few days later I traveled to Riva del Garda, Italy, to present findings from that paper at the 2010 INSNA Sunbelt conference.  One week later I departed for a 3-week trek through the trans-Himalayan range of northern India.  Yes, it was quite an incredible summer. ![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2010/09/09272010-04-Map.png)

#### What's next?

I'm back in session for my final quarter [SCAD](http://www.scad.edu/design-management/), hammering away on my thesis and trying to figure out where to kick off the next chapter of my life, so expect more posts covering these exact points over the next few months.
