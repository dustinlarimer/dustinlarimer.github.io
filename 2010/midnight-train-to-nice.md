# Midnight Train to Nice

Shortly after my brother arrived in Paris we stocked up on provisions (cheese and beer) and boarded a night train bound for Nice.  A bit of unsolicited travel advice (I'll be giving a lot of it on this site) for your next planned trip to Europe – _or,_ perhaps you're debating a last-minute, change-of-clothes escape and are looking for an enabler – grab yourself a [Eurail Pass](http://www.eurail.com/) and a timetable, and highlight all of the 8 to 14 hour long overnight routes you can find.  Then just figure it out as you go.  Seriously... We never anticipated we would find ourselves in Nice but a mere €20,00 sleeper-car upgrade fee meant a simple place to sleep, followed by fancy hair cuts and breakfast on the Mediterranean.  Just wing it.
