# First Days in Leh

We arrived in Leh on July 14th and spent a few days acclimating to the altitude — 11,500ft isn't terribly unmanageable, but your body needs to adjust properly to avoid or minimize altitude mountain sickness, not to mention the slightly more _unsurvivable_ conditions, like High Altitude Pulmonary Embolism. During this initial 'take it easy' phase we visited a massive Stupa overlooking Leh, and then ventured a few kilometers from town to visit an oracle healer.  The landscape was ruggedly beautiful – a vast expanse of orange rock and jagged bluffs.  This could have been the surface of Mars beneath a piercing, crisp blue sky.
