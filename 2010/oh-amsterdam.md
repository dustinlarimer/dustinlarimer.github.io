# Oh, Amsterdam!

By the time we arrived in Amsterdam we were pretty exhausted on the fast pace of travel we had designed for ourselves.  I really don't think I would have made it through this trip if my brother hadn't been with me... It was so important to have someone to share the stresses and the challenges with.  In a proper show of gratitude, I now shame his lack of noodle prowess. Derek was having a terrible time getting his noodles to cooperate... he eventually just lost his appetite altogether out of shear frustration. I, on the other hand, lost mine from laughing too hard (trimmed out, for pride's sake).
