# "A chair is not a thing. It is a place of activity."

[fve]http://vimeo.com/20379481[/fve] "A chair is not a thing. It is a place of activity." Interaction Design is the design of the way humans relate to one another, through the mediating influence of products. _What is a product?_ 1. **Useful** (logos): technological reasoning, intellectual content, does work, the right materials (what you think is interacting). 2. **Usable** (ethos): speaks in a language that my mind can comprehend. 3. **Desirable **(pathos): a quality of ethos that you want to be part of and bring into your life. "The material of interaction design are the purposes and desires of the people we serve. That comes to us as clay, and we form that clay.  We shape and express, give deep endurance, to the purposes and values of other people." Richard Buchanan: Keynote (by [Interaction Design Association](http://vimeo.com/20379481))
