# This Week in the Twittersphere: 2010-09-13

* "Box371! Box371, where are you?!" Old cops 'n robbers TV show, or a Star Wars ref? Experiencing my .1% downtime for the year (thx @[Bluehost](http://twitter.com/Bluehost))
  * Hey @[bluehost](http://twitter.com/bluehost), quick question- would it be possible to have my site up most of the time? Not all.. that's just crazy.. but like 99.9% maybe?
  * Oh, good.. I was afraid I was the only @[bluehost](http://twitter.com/bluehost) customer with elevated blood pressure today..
  * Well, guess what? Turns out it was everyone else's fault.. Way to crack the case, #[BP](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23BP) #[integrity](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23integrity) #fourfingersbackatyou <http://bit.ly/9FBlRv>
