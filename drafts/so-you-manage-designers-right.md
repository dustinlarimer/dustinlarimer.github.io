# Ah, so you manage designers, right?

I recently completed an [MFA in Design Management](http://www.scad.edu/design-management/) from SCAD. The program name invites a lot of great conversations, which usually start with a cautious "Hmm.. So... what exactly is that?!" I have a few perspectives of my own, but they just don't quite compare to that of  the guy who "made it all up." :) The Design Management manifesto, by Robert Fee: 

> For organizations who wish to channel their resources toward the most efficient, humane and stunningly original ways to their customer’s heart, Effective design management creates the environment for creative approaches to the difficult and mundane alike, fosters a shared holistic vision that can be understood and manipulated by enterprise development teams, and drives the creation of actionable objectives that ensure that ideas become reality. We do this through a passion and understanding of design as thinking, design as doing, and design as collaboration. We do this by knowing the driving forces of commerce, organizational objectives and the motivating factors behind decision-making. We do this with a commitment to innovation, sustainable solutions for society, and sound ethical responsibility to all those we serve. Unlike other forms of operational or strategic management, the design manager fosters new perceptions and continuous renewal of the points of view of our industry, partners, customers, and community. Like other forms of management, the design manager must have practical working knowledge of the financial, intellectual, temporal and human capital that makes the organization successful. We approach our craft with the dedicated idea that it is most important in life, as in commerce, to make a difference; profits make an enterprise run, but purpose is its reason for being. 5/25/05

...and, from the [SCAD program](http://www.scad.edu/design-management/) page: 

> With a foundation in organizational anthropology, collaborative learning, brand analytics, design principles and business practices, the design management program introduces design thinking into all operations of organizations. Design management students develop an understanding of the vital role of creativity as strategic advantage when incorporated into traditional business activities.
