# Influences

Creativity is a product of social interaction. We exist for each other — we are designed to influence and enrich each other to create new possibilities for novelty. Even the most extraordinary achievements of great individuals were socially inspired; the culmination of untold years of experience and insight handed down through time, exchanged, debated, expanded and refined, day-in and day-out. **The world is built by friends.** Here are a few of mine: 

  * [Amit Bapat](http://www.emergingintuitions.com/joomla/thesis/)
  * [R Campbell](http://iam-r.com/)
  * [Jen Light](http://jenmadethis.tumblr.com/)
  * [Audrey Tan](http://www.coroflot.com/public/individual_details.asp?individual_id=92666)
  * [Matt Cole](http://www.behance.net/matthewcole)
  * [Yushi Wang](http://strongwong17.wordpress.com/)
  * [Jonathan Stovall](http://jonathanstovall.com/)
  * [Bj Dierkes](http://www.5dollarwhitebox.org/)
I'm currently (perpetually) on the road, but when I get settled into my next destination this section is going to get blown out into a proper showcase of everyones' work, book recommendations, favorite writers and bloggers... it's going to be great.
