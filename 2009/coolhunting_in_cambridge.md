# CoolHunting in Cambridge

A few weeks ago I had the good fortune to attend a CoolHunting Academy at MIT in Cambridge. The week-long workshop marked the kickoff of an exciting collaborative research initiative between MIT, Savannah College of Art & Design, University of Helsinki and University of Cologne.  CoolHunting operates by the principles of swarm creativity and collective intelligence. No one person knows everything about any single topic, but together our collective knowledge about a topic is immense. By observing and analyzing the emergent patterns of communication within social networks we can identify and track trends as they ripple through society. We can also scale the centrality of actors within a given network, meaning the ease of access any particular node has with any other node within the network. If I mention several people in an article, that really doesn't mean too much for my own centrality. But if several people each mention me in their own articles, I must be a significant person and my centrality is increased. Those who are more central are considered to be trendsetters, thought leaders, or gatekeepers within a particular network. Condor is an exciting program developed under [Peter Gloor](http://cci.mit.edu/pgloor) at MIT that allows us to troll the vast ocean of content that is the active conversation of the web and then aggregate, analyze and visualize the massive amount of information that is pulled back. As we learned during our week in Cambridge, the best way to understand this software is to see it in action. And so, I will attempt to demonstrate a quick application of Condor in a market very near and dear to my heart. 

#### Exploring the Mobile Applications Market

> In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race. – Al Ries & Jack Trout. authors of The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing

In June of 2007 Apple released a revolutionary new device that forever changed both the mobile telecommunications and digital media download industries. While the the device itself has become the focus of much salivating and shameless imitation, the real success of the artifact can be largely attributed to the explosion of applications brought forth by enterprising young developers the world over. A whole new frontier was opened up, and naturally many of the best-suited competitors scrambled to grab what little scraps of market-share Apple left available. Behind the iPhone platform we find Google Android, BlackBerry, and the Palm Pre. If it is true that "every market becomes a two-horse race," then perhaps we can catch a glimpse of the tone of the web to see how this market will play. 

#### Condor in Action

Step 1: First I want to see the relative scale of activity of the terms "iPhone App," "Android App," "BlackBerry App" and "Palm Pre App" on the web. CoolTrend.ch is designed to do just that. CoolTrend.ch lets visually maps out the relationship between results of search queries, allowing me to very quickly see the most central hubs of information within the network. This alone could turn the world of web advertising appraisals on its head, but let's bench that discussion for another time. Figure 1a shows the output from this process. Surprisingly, iPhone - the untouchable market leader - owns just 31% of the web buzz-share, trailing Google's 33%. BlackBerry App follows with 25%, and Palm Pre App with only 11%. The iPhone is certainly not going anywhere, having recently announced its one-billionth app download from its App Store, but removing it from the analysis yields another interesting perspective. ￼![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5009319988_67de618184.jpg)Figure 1a. CoolTrend output for "iPhone App" "BlackBerry App" "Palm Pre App" & "Google Android App" Figure 1b shows the aggregate web buzz of "Google Android App," "BlackBerry App," and "Palm Pre App." Google weighs in with 44%, BlackBerry takes 39%, and Palm picks up the last 17%. One could now argue that Google is shaping up to be a pretty solid "second horse," but BlackBerry is keeping a fairly close margin. ![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4083/5009319810_ffd86a8613_o.gif)Figure 1b. CoolTrend output for "BlackBerry App" "Palm Pre App" & "Google Android App" Step 2: I want to see what key terms are being used within the blogosphere regarding "iPhone App," "Google Android App," "BlackBerry App" and "Palm Pre App." I could probably sit down and write out a nice long list of what I think are key terms within the industry, but there's no way to ensure I'll catch every single relevant word. I fire up MySQL, launch Condor, create a new database, and set the "One Degree Collector" loose on Google blog search. Condor hits Google up for the returned snippets of 20 results for each query and creates a new data-set for each term. Next I run "Content Process" to calculate and extract the most frequently used terms for each data-set. Those terms are then compiled together to create a pretty accurate snapshot of the key terminology used in reference to my original four queries. I want to visualize the relative association of these terms, so merge my four data-sets together (after making a backup, of course) and run the Content Process again against the new single data-set. This time I also import my list of industry terms. Figure 2 shows the resultant Static View of Terms output for my merged data-set. Terms appear as nodes within a network, connected by edges (blue lines) and spatially arranged to demonstrate how frequently they occur together. ![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4103/5008714923_971f9a05cf.jpg)Figure 2. Static View of Terms for Industry Terminology Device names and related terms cluster together in different regions of the map - Palm Pre appears far left, Google Android appears top just left of center, Apple appears far top right, and BlackBerry below and just right of center - all orbiting around the golden item of the day: the word "app." Something very interesting is already visible in the area of Palm Pre. Notice the other terms clustering around Palm's related terms. "itunes" is the big anomaly, as well as "syncing," "upgrade," "coming," "pre owners," etc. Palm and Apple have recently been locked in a "Sync War" as Palm attempts to allow the Pre to sync with iTunes. Apple responded by pushing updated versions of iTunes to disallow this behavior. Apparently they have been going back and forth for awhile now and we can clearly see this info resonating through the blogosphere. It's possible this contributed to Palm's 11-17% of web buzz-share from earlier. Another interesting detail from the Palm cluster is that a few outlier terms such as "delayed," "waiting," "Lonely" connect with terms like "application" and "app catalog." I run a quick google search with those terms plus "Palm Pre App" and find a plethora of articles citing serious development problems when authoring apps. Step 3: I need to get a little deeper into these devices so I create a new database and run the "Blog Collector" tool. This is essentially the same component as the One Degree Collector, except it submits an addition query for each result for each additional degree you request. For example, if I request 20 results at a degree of 2 I could potentially pull back 400 articles for each of my four queries: "iPhone App," "Google Android App," "BlackBerry App" and "Palm Pre App." I also opt to include the full content of the results, which takes a considerable amount of time but will give me the depth of information that I need.
