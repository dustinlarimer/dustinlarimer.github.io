# Killer Bike Locks

Recognizing that a great idea is really only as great as its execution, this exercise focused on the behind-the-scenes mechanics of product development: financial feasibility and market development.  Our first task was to conceive of an original, exciting idea that could be developed further into an actual product... easy stuff, right?  For efficacy's sake, we chose to leverage our familiarities, so we each listed out a dozen or so groups that we belong to: young adults, designers, grad students, athletes, musicians, etc. For each of these we explored various problems and inconveniences that we have personally experienced. As many students living in Savannah know, one major problem to address is bicycle theft. What's even more concerning than Savannah's above-average crime statistics is an unusually high tolerance for crime in general, leaving many bicycling students reasonably frustrated with the heightened risk they accept during their time at SCAD. In a moment of vigilante sarcasm, I asked "wouldn't it be nice if there was a device that would shock the ever-livin' shit out of whoever was trying to steal your bike?" The Yellow-Jacket Bike Lock System was born. [Download the final project documents](../Documents/SCAD_BUSI710-PFM.zip)
