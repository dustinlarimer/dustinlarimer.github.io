# Century Media Interactive Promo Apps

I joined Century Media Record's campaign for world domination as a hired gun for IME-Tech, a then LA-based IT firm that was contracted to keep the label online. I have been a long-time heavy music aficionado, so I nearly messed myself when the position was offered. 

#### The Setup

Every few days I would receive a .zip file of a few bands' artwork source files, a few simple requests or campaign goals, and a creative free pass. For nearly two years I designed one half of Century Media's e-cards, splash pages, marketing banners, buddy icons and desktop wallpaper, with an occasional Enhanced CD application thrown in every once in awhile. I also helped out with routine site maintenance and upgrades for Century Media, CMDistro, and Liquor & Poker Music. ![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5008814430_8822fab90a.jpg)
