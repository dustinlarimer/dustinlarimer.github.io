# Unity Blueprint

Unity Blueprint is a collective initiative by many groups around the nation aimed at advocating progressive immigration reform. I joined this project as a hired gun for IME-Tech, a then LA-based IT firm that was contracted by the group to maintain Unity Blueprint's IT infrastructure and produce new sites as needed. The goal of this site was to serve as a hub of information as legal documents became available. Visitors and businesses could also join the initiative roster and grab action-kits to promote awareness in their own areas. I designed and built a number of their sites, but it wasn't until later in the contract that I really started to understand the impact of what we were doing. We went through dozens of iterations for this particular project, such as the following - which they thought was a little too severe but I had a hard time dropping. ![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4146/5008209349_194808ce70.jpg) I know immigration reform is a hot-button issue right now, and the last thing I want to do is paint myself as one of these or one of those. I am against pushing political ideologies in a professional forum. I do sympathize, however, on behalf of the thousands of children whose parents never came home from work following the December 2006 ICE raids on several Swift Co. facilities across the U.S.  Many of the children were left alone for weeks because their parents were immediately deported and no one else knew they were left alone. 

#### Disclaimer

I'm not a critic of ICE \- I think they play an integral role in protecting our country - but I think the raids could have been managed better. I haven't worked with Unity Blueprint since early 2007, so I make no claims to anything they've done since.
