# The Pistils

The Pistils were a punk pop quartette based out of Denver, Colorado. Though their run lasted only a few blurry years, the playful originality of their music influenced nearly every band they shared a stage with. Their band and my own band shared a unique bro-ship that went back over a decade, so I decided to build this site to help them out. ![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5008696688_107a572bd0.jpg)

#### The Direction

In retrospect, this project was largely a conceptual experiment. Their sound held a sort of timeless innocence that I wanted to capture in their online identity, so what better style to bite on than the Nick@Nite "Classic Television" era? I was living on my keyboardist's couch at the time, so I committed a few all-nighters to illustrating old televisions onto their bodies, as well as cameramen, fans and a big glowing marquee. This epic production is happening in your back yard, right outside your window. 

#### The Result

While reaction to the new theme was unanimously positive, the site went live just as the band was winding down. This project was an excellent learning experience, opened a lot of doors while exploring Illustrator and Flash.
