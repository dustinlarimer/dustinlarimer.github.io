# Black Heart Booking

Black Heart Booking is an independent booking and promotion agency in Lincoln (formerly based out of Kearney), Nebraska. I was immediately blown away by the potential of this company. BHB was booking Gym Class Heroes in hotel bars in Nebraska years before you ever heard of 'em. They also had a great following of fans and supporters in and around the community. Most of BHB's promotion was already happening on Myspace, so rather than fix what wasn't broken we directed the project towards creating an interactive media-hub where BHB could post photos, videos, and album reviews, while leveraging the social web to expand involvement. Additionally, we wanted to create a sharp new company image to improve public perception of the business. 

#### The Direction

First, I fleshed out a sharp new identity concept. The status quo of music sites seems to be grungy on black, so we decided to be radicals and go with grungy on white. The owner wanted to be able to upload news articles and reviews and manage club/venue network associations. Additionally, bands and fans would be able to create profiles and join the Black Heart Artist Roster or Black Heart Street Team, respectively. I designed and developed a dynamic data-driven site sitting atop a custom CMS to make it all happen. 

#### The Result

The site has received a lot of positive feedback, and has done a good job of connecting the agency with their fans and artists across the Midwest. BHB has since packed up shop and moved to eastern Nebraska, but continues to book and promote shows around the Lincoln/Omaha area.
