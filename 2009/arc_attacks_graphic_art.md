# Arc Attacks Graphic Art

This site was built for the Arc Attacks, a sci-fi, steam punk influenced four man crew from Austin, Texas, during Knowbility's AIR-Interactive competition at SXSW.  I was a member of the USAA team for this contest, as well as the previous AIR Rally in San Antonio in November, 2007.

#### The Direction

The Arc Attacks have big plans. They were being contacted occasionally about opportunities to tour with large production groups and needed a place to document their news, achievements, event photos and contact information. My team divided responsibilities and off we went. My role was to develop a graphic concept to represent the band's fusion of science and music, and, once the team was satisfied, build a dynamic PHP framework for the site. 

#### The Result

The site came together in record time, and we were very thorough about hitting all the point-marks for the competition, but unfortunately the other teams wore their butt kicking cleats. We didn't place, but we brought a great wealth of accessibility information back to our fellow coworkers at USAA, who continue to advocate for and develop accessible web applications.
