# MediaFire Studios

MediaFire Studios was an interactive multimedia studio providing a wide array of world-class creative services and skills, while focusing on developing and maintaining strong long-term working relationships with clients and customers. Sounds about right, eh? This was actually a final project for an E-Commerce class. 

#### The Direction

The project had two major deliverables: 1. a deluxe business plan detailing every aspect of the business, and 2. a complete site based on that business plan, ready to stand and deliver. You can read MediaFire Studios' complete business plan in the link below, and view the live site online. ![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5008816992_89bcfaa4c0.jpg) I created a sharp, unique business identity to help introduce the new media firm to the public and increase marketability in an otherwise desolate multimedia market: central Nebraska. I've always been a fan of plaid, and it seems to be in short supply on the web. I designed and developed the site with an integrated dynamic data-driven back end to allow for easy maintenance. 

#### The Result

I received an A for the project. After the class was over I decided to leave the site online and forget about it. Well, that may not have been my plan but that was what happened. About a year later I hoped online to check the site's mail and saw quite a few requests for project quotes. I even got a few resumes! Had I seriously pursued the business, evidence suggests it could have been fairly profitable. I'll mark that as a success.
