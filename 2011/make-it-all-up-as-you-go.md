# Make It All Up as You Go

Building a roadmap for innovation can be tricky business.  Discovering and actualizing an opportunity that qualifies as "innovative" means you went into the wilderness on a hunch (either your own or a client's) to snare a beast that no one has ever actually seen.  There is _something_ out there (we think), so get moving and bring us its head(s).  It's wonderfully exciting work, but strange to plan/account/bill for on its face.  Even the best-executed Design programs are loaded with "so what the hell do we do now?" moments.  Decisions made in those moments are where the secret sauce of your namesake comes from. Improvisation is one of the most critical components of Design leadership.  Yet it's in our very nature to keep moving down the knowledge funnel, ditching our wonderful knack for turning mysteries into heuristics for the repeated success of a billable, scalable formula.  We move faster based on past experience, we get into a rhythm and start knocking projects out of the park one after another.  There's no reason to argue with success, right?  Go apologize to every client you've ever chastised for saying that.  Be ashamed. Design is a profession of perpetual renegotiation and reinvention.  It's tempting to build structural assurances for success, but a Design process can and should never be fully repeatable – it's a momentary and emergent response to highly dynamic circumstances and converging factors that you've never encountered, every time.  To apply the same "known way forward" to every such instance creates the conditions for _closed-cultural recursion_.  When we become too closely associated with a successful method for approaching problems, our interpretation of the mysterious unknown begins to reflect the tacit determinacy of the world as our method requires it to be.  Instead, let's focus on fostering a culture of procedural reinvention for its own sake, and developing a toolkit for developing toolkits. When I started by thesis, _Identifying & Exploring New Opportunities for Technological Innovation & Reconfiguration in the Independent Food Sector_, I had no idea what kind methods or exercises I would employ.  I'm familiar with plenty, but I certainly didn't know that almost everything I did for this project would either be made up from scratch or a novel composite of various methods and models.  I knew that I knew very little about the independent food space, and so I would have to find people to learn from and work with.  I've been quite fascinated with the research and writing of [Peter Gloor](http://www.ickn.org/) and his team at MIT.  I also hoped to invent some great new technological _something or another_ so **[Geoffrey Moore's](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0066620023/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dustlari-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0066620023)** work was very much in mind.  What resulted from the mashup of these works and others was an SNA-driven analysis of the independent food community within the regional scope of my research to identify a small group of visionaries and thought-leaders who could best represent – and design for – the community at large. ![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2011/06/sna-chasm_sm-498x380.jpg) This group taught me what really matters within their respective context, and revealed new insights into the _strategic trajectory_ of their shared practice.  As the conversation evolved from 'what is' to 'what could be' these participants began shaping new possibilities and actively informing the design process.  When this collaboratively developed invention is ready for show time, this team of co-designers will be the best-positioned in their respective networks to validate and promote adoption by their peers. ![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2011/06/thesis-interview.jpg) You could probably build an entire consultancy around this process (it certainly worked well this time around), but I'm not chomping at the bit to use it again.  The approach emerged in response to specific circumstances, but wouldn't have been possible without being aware of and inspired by the work of Gloor and Moore.  So should I spend my time exploiting this one process, or casting my net wider and expanding my conceptual base for responding to future challenges?  When asked how your team will approach a challenge, it's ok to answer "I haven't the slightest idea, but we'll figure that out as we go."
