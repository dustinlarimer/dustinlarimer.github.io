# A snarky tweet that became a website

Time to change things up!  I decided my old site was just too damn busy for how little it accomplished.  It was sort of set up like a super-hub for all that I do.  I thought that would put the mania to order and inspire more writing, but it just compounded the mess and inhibited the free-flow of ideas that I had originally set out to unleash. The idea has been floating around for awhile, but it became a reality this past Thursday.  A friend posted a link to some special media of the morning and after getting my chuckle my eye gazed across the rest of the page.  Right there in the right sidebar was a familiar widget we've all seen thousands of times: "Related articles."  Except it wasn't titled just that.  It was titled "Posts that are probably related."  They weren't.  What an f'n cop out, and a total waste of effort.  There is nothing useful about that.  It's bullshit.  It's filler for filler's sake.  I opened TweetDeck, ready to unleash hell, when I thought "well, if that's bad then my own site is total garbage.  I mean I import my Flickr feed on every single sidebar!"  I withheld the tweet and fired up Illustrator.  And here we are. The plan here is to cut the crap.  More writing, more ideas, open for iteration and improvement, and _hopefully_ a little more exchange with you all as well ;)  Let's do this!

A thought: I didn't see an easy way to comment on your posts from the homepage...and since it shows the full length of the post, it wasn't very friendly for me to know what to do (ie. clicking on the post title to leave a comment). Maybe just throwing a 'leave a comment link' underneath the 'sharethis' would do. Sorry if there is an easy way and I just missed it. Chais

**[Dustin](#52 "2011-06-26 12:14:28"):** Yeah, thanks Chais — good call! I definitely need to add that!
