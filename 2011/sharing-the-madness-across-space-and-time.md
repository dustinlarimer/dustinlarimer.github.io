# Sharing the madness across space and time

![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2011/07/3_view.jpg) Early-stage collaborative way-finding is a messy good time.  Teams dive head first into abject calamity, gobbled up in an avalanche of complexity and losing all sense of up or down, but soon identify patterns and relationships to help make sense of what they're experiencing.  These patterns then mature into models of causalities, agent incentives and other perceptual gravities, which can then be recycled or validated through iterative storytelling and prototyping. ![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2011/07/0_pre1.jpg) Much of this exploratory process occurs as a conversation in a language that pre-dates verbal communication – visual association, dissociation and self-projection.  Objects and concepts are clustered into categories and topics, possibilities are sketched, stories are developed and prototypes are built, all the while fueling a recursive reinterpretation of an emerging design opportunity. ![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2011/07/0_pre2.jpg) The problem is that these methods go to hell when your team is scattered around the globe.  Enter the idea.  This concept was developed over coffee with [Robert Fee](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=5070203), professor of [Design Management at SCAD](http://www.scad.edu/design-management/), while discussing something entirely unrelated (as is often the case). This app is an augmented reality harness that synchronizes a canvas across all teammates' devices, and projects that canvas into real space through the camera viewport.  Ideally it will be able to inherit existing canvas-based applications like Adobe Illustrator. Starting or joining a project requires a quick and easy calibration. **Rest the device face-down** on the table (or flat against a wall) and press a large "calibration" button.  The app calculates it's location, elevation and orientation, which will all inform the projection until the project is re-calibrated in a new location. ![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2011/07/1_calibrate.jpg) **Step back and look** through the viewport.  The canvas will remain mathematically true to the point of calibration.  Rather than saving your project into a folder, you save it on your coffee table, or perhaps on the wall above your desk.  As you glance around your office through your viewport you'll see all of your active projects in constant flux as teammates sort, sketch and synthesize in a shared space. ![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2011/07/3_view.jpg) ![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2011/07/4_table.jpg) ![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2011/07/5_wall.jpg) I expect this app will require some heavy-lifting in the background, similar in nature to GitHub's project forking and version management.  Perhaps a "host-it-yourself" switchboard service (think [Diaspora](https://joindiaspora.com/)) would be an effective way to keep devices synced in real time.  It will need to be fully plug-and-play with as little configuration or maintenance as possible, with uncontested and irrevocable content ownership to speed adoption by enterprise-level design research teams. **Would anyone like to make this happen?** I welcome all comments, questions and suggestions.

**[yushi](#56 "2011-07-11 16:02:17"):** Hi Dustin, this is a brilliant concept. Based on my experiences, it looks a lot like the mobile apps with many incredible happy users, even those iphone games with a lot of fun. They are identically SIMPLY to use, with flatten learning curve. I guess we could start make some scenarios to explore the fundamental supplemental collaborative elements the mobile device would essentially contribute; also looking at the gestures or capability of the mobile platform, see what would be the preferable turnout. I don't think any technology will substitute the face2face interaction. However, I strongly believe we can develop something with high value added to support and enhance collaboration. y

**[Dustin](#57 "2011-07-11 16:09:30"):** Thanks, Yushi! I agree, nothing can replace good 'ol face-to-face collaboration. My hope is that something like this would help augment existing methods and bridge the gaps caused by travel and other spatial obstacles. One important component would be the ability to parse and digitize a wall of post-its, diagrams, sketches, etc.

**[yushi](#58 "2011-07-11 17:07:39"):** Awesome!!!!I will spend sometime try to brainstorm something. Once I got back to savannah, I will post my thoughts. Let's keep something open going.

**[Chris Miller](#59 "2011-07-12 12:34:10"):** Dustin, your idea takes computer-supported collaborative work to a new level. While I don't have the tech background to help on that dimension, I'm very interested in contributing to the user-side and dynamics of sociality.

**[Dustin](#60 "2011-07-12 12:40:54"):** Thanks, Chris – very much appreciated!

**[Joel Reyna](#61 "2011-07-16 05:19:44"):** I would love to use this App as part of a larger tool for collaboration that I am developing. I am also interested in Neighbor Farms and curious as to why you have "parked" it!

**[Dustin](#62 "2011-07-16 14:15:07"):** Thanks for the comment, Joel. By no means is NeighborFarms parked – we're coding like madmen to get it built out to a point where we can invite producers and their customers in for a closed pilot. Much of the functionality we need just hasn't been done before either, so it's taking some time.
