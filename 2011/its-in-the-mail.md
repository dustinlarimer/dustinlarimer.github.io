# It's in the mail...

![](http://www.dustinlarimer.com/content/uploads/2011/06/cd-mailers.jpg) **It may be hard to throw out old CD’s, but it’s fairly easy to box them all up and mail them to your friends.** A few years ago I tried replacing the jewel cases with soft cases, but ended up with a 50/50 split. This time around the pile was small enough to get them all into a USPS flat-rate “If it fits, it ships” mailer and sent them all off to my friends in Colorado.  Each of us will get a brief turn with each other’s archive before passing it on to the next guy. Except I don’t have a return address at the moment, so someone will have to hold on to mine for awhile :D
